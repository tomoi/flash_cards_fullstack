# Flash Cards
## TypeScript + React
This is a personal project I am making to improve my skills with React and to gain experience with TypeScript.
It is a webpage that allows the user to make flashcards to help them study.
It runs fully in the browser, and is being made 100% by me, with no help from AI or anything similar.
